In the movePoint method, the operation x = 100; y = 120; is performed,
but the output is (x, y) = (8, 5) and the values are not updated. 
This is because x, y in the test constructor and x, y in the movePoint method are different.
Arguments of basic data types are passed to the method by value. 
That is, if you change the value of a parameter in the movePoint method, 
it is all valid only within the movePoint method, 
because it does not affect the x, y values in the constructor.
