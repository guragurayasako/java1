/*
B: Hello World [1 pt]
Your task is to create a program that outputs the string "Hello World‚Äù. The class name should be HelloWorld.
Use the following template for this problem.

class HelloWorld{
 public static void main(String[] args){
 // your codes
 }
}

Standard output is essential for developing applications, but it is also essential for learning programming
languages. This is because the values of variables are output to the screen in a timely manner to check the
operation of a program while learning. To output strings to standard output, use the System.out.println()
method.
To display character literals, enclose the relevant string in "(double quotation marks)".

System.out.println("hello");*/
class HelloWorld{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello World");
	}
}
